### Taming the console with tmux.

#### Intro

When transitioning from GUIs to the console people tend to be overwhelmed with
the difficulties of controlling all the multiple processes (and its
input/output) you may be running concurrently.

[Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) can help with that.

#### What is tmux?

Here is the raw definition: A terminal multiplexer. And what is a terminal?
It is a physical dumb device used to send and receive (text) to and from a
machine.  We also have the software version of that: a terminal emulator,
which is a piece of software that replicates the features of a terminal.

We can also think about this tool as a window manager for the terminal. With
tmux we can launch multiple terminals each running its own process. For
example, I am writing this document within a tmux session that has multiple
windows:

I have 8 window, each of them running multiple programs, in window number 7 I
have an instance of vim for the document I am editing:

There is one more feature I want to point out about tmux: *detaching* from a
session. You can have leave (detach) an active tmux session, when doing that,
tmux will take care of the output from the different windows (and its
terminals) so you can *reattach* to that session and pick it up where you left
it. That is extremely powerful.

#### Installation

Installing tmux is pretty straight forward as it is available as a precompiled
package in my unix flavors. Look for tmux in your favorite package manager, if
you cannot find it, use the source code and compile it for your target machine.

#### Basic usage

To start tmux we just execute its binary: ```$ tmux```, that will create a new
tmux session and will link our current terminal to it.

Now, if we ```$ exit```, tmux will terminate that session.

You can name a session so you can identify what you are running on them, to do
so, we use the ```-s``` option: ```$ tmux new -s first``` where ```first``` is
the name of the session.

To communicate with tmux, we use a shortcuts prefixed with a key combination.
By default that is: ```Ctrl-b```.

For example, if we want to detach ourselves from a session we do so by typing:
```Ctrl-b``` (the prefix) followed by ```d```.

Now, to reattach to that session we can:

```sh
$ tmux ls
0: 8 windows (created Wed Dec  4 10:00:35 2013) [178x49]
```

since we only have one session, we can just run:

```$ tmux attach```

#### windows

Windows are created by typing: ```PREFIX c``` (create). Once you are in the
new window, you can rename its name with ```PREFIX ,```.

#### Panes

Within windows we can create panes, so we can see the output of the processes
running on each pane in the same window. To split a window vertically press:
```PREFIX %``` and ```PREFIX "``` to split horizontally.

Here you have a tmux window, within a session that has 3 panes. In number 0
we are doing some editing with, same in number 1 (but for a different file) and
in pane number 2 we have the ```top``` command running.

#### Final remarks

In this brief introduction we have just scratched the power of tmux. Refer to
the reference section if you want to learn more about this great tool.
